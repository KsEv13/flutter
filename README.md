<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Flutter App with "Chuck Norris"-related jokes.
The goal of the project is to get acquainted with Flutter (the use of http, Stateful and Stateless 
Widgets such as MaterialApp, Scaffold, SafeArea, Row, Padding, etc.) 
by creating the app with linters and Chuck Norris Jokes Api.
The joke is updated by pressing "like"/"dislike" buttons or by swiping in left/right directions.
Also, you can open the current joke in the browser by going to the option in the menu.

### Built With

* [![Flutter][Flutter.com]][Flutter-url]

### Format change and Linters

I have used flutter_lints - a set of recommended lints for Flutter 
apps, packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices. 
Also, I have specified the additional set of rules regarding style, formatting and doc comments.
To apply the above-mentioned rules I used the following commands:
